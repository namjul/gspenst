> Gspenst is an austrian word for ghost. It combines ideas from [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org/) ([contexts](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/contexts/), [routing](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/)) with [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/), served with [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) (currently working on astro port)
